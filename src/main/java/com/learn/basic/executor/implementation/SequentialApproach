Method simply accepts an order and tries to execute it.
It blocks other requests till current request is completed

void receiveAndExecuteClientOrders() {
    while(true) {
        Order order = waitForNextOrder();
        order.execute();
    }
}
*Limitation of the approach*
  # Application creates unlimited number of threads
  # Active thread consume memory even if they are idle.
  # There is limit imposed by JVM and underlying OS on the number of thread that can be created.
